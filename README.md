# glassware-bot
The main goal of the project was to control a robot using an intuitive Google Glass interface. The Google Glass Android application recorded data from the Glass's Accelerometer and sent it to the mbed on the Sparkfun Magician Robot over a Bluetooth connection. Basic commands include tilting head to determine direction and speed of movement. Other features include snpping pictures via Bluetooth and saving images to robotâ€™s SD card and interactively viewing the cardinal direction of the robot.
